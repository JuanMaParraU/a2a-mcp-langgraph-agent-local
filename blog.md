🧠 TL;DR
Conceptually:

* Agentic AI = reasoning LLMs autonomously executing multi-step processes

* A2A (Agent-to-Agent) = protocol enabling standardised communication with and between agents, and discovery of their capabilities

* MCP (Model Context Protocol) = standardised way for agents to access tools and APIs consistently

Implementation:

* Agentic SDKs use LLMs as reasoning engines

* A2A SDK wraps agent code, exposing its capabilities via a standard protocol

* MCP SDK wraps tools/APIs, exposing them via a standard protocol

In this tutorial, you’ll interact with an Agent via A2A, which accesses tools through MCP — all running locally with open-source software. If you want to skip the guide and go straight to the code 👉👉 🔗 GitHub Repository


💡 Introduction
We're at a pivotal moment in AI development. Whilst recent years focused on scaling models and refining APIs, the next frontier is autonomy—AI systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks independently.

When I started exploring agentic systems, I hit a wall: there was no complete, end-to-end implementation using only open-source tools. Everything required subscriptions, API keys, or vendor lock-in. I wanted pure, experimentation-ready infrastructure that anyone could run locally and understand fully.

So I built one.

This project combines the open-source LangGraph (agentic workflows), MCP (tool integration), and A2A (agent communication)—all running locally with models served through Ollama. It's designed for developers and researchers who want:

Full control over their agentic workflows

Privacy with no external LLM API calls

Zero cost for unlimited experimentation  

Transparency to understand exactly how everything works

Whether you're new to agentic AI or migrating from cloud-based solutions to local infrastructure, this provides a practical and hackable foundation that you can build upon.

🧠 Background & Key Concepts
🤖 Why Agentic AI Matters
Agentic AI marks an evolution from reactive to proactive, goal-oriented systems. Instead of prompt-response patterns, these systems:

Plan their own actions

Call tools or APIs when needed

Collaborate with other agents

Adapt dynamically to context

This enables autonomous digital co-workers capable of reasoning and action — the foundation for next-generation intelligent automation.

🧩 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Developed by Anthropic, MCP defines a standard interface for models to connect with tools and data sources safely and consistently. Rather than framework-specific plugin systems, MCP provides a shared language for capability access, enabling true interoperability.

🔁 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication
When multiple agents coexist, they need structured communication. A2A provides this framework — defining how agents exchange messages, delegate tasks, and collaborate on shared objectives.

Together, MCP and A2A create the foundation for cooperative, extensible agent ecosystems that grow organically rather than through rigid scripting.


⚙️ Implementation
🔗 Repository Structure
a2a-mcp-langgraph-agent-local demonstrates a local-first agentic architecture combining:

🧭 LangGraph — orchestrates agents and state transitions

🔌 MCP — standardizes tool access

💬 A2A — handles inter-agent communication

⚙️ Ollama — serves models locally without external APIs

Why local matters:

No API costs — experiment freely without worrying about tokens or rate limits

Complete privacy — your data never leaves your machine

Full observability — inspect every message, state transition, and decision

Total control — modify, extend, and customize without platform constraints

Reproducibility — share exact environments for research and development

🔍 Code Highlights
The implementation focuses on clarity and practical understanding:

# Minimal StateGraph for agent orchestration
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("agent1", agent1_node)
graph.add_node("agent2", agent2_node)

# A2A message passing
await send_message(from_agent="agent1", 
                   to_agent="agent2",
                   content={"task": "analyze"})

# MCP tool integration
tools = mcp_client.list_tools()
result = await mcp_client.call_tool("filesystem_read", 
                                     {"path": "data.json"})

This gives you hands-on experience with agentic systems from an implementation perspective — understanding not just what these concepts mean, but how they actually work together in code.


🧪 Possible Enhancements
This is a foundation, not a finished product. Here are directions I'm considering — and I'd love your input:

🔭 Graph Visualization — add observability tools for agent state and transitions

🧩 Advanced A2A Patterns — implement negotiation, consensus, and error recovery protocols

⚙️ Extended MCP Tools — integrate databases, REST APIs, and custom data sources

🧠 Model Experimentation — benchmark different local models for specific agent tasks

🤝 Plugin System — create an extension framework for community-built agents and tools

What would you build with this? What tools should we prioritize next?


🧭 Conclusion
I built this project to share my understanding of agentic systems from a practical, implementation-focused perspective. If you're starting with agentic AI or trying to move to fully local, controlled workflows, I hope this provides a useful foundation.

More importantly, this is an invitation to collaborate. Agentic AI is evolving rapidly, and the best innovations will come from shared knowledge and open experimentation.
